# Array Methods

## Learning Goals

- Add elements to an `Array`
- Remove elements from an `Array`
- Replace elements in an `Array`

## Introduction

In the last lesson, we learned about JavaScript `Array`s, including how to
create them and access their elements. In this lab, we will dive into
JavaScript's `Array` methods, which enable us to add, remove, and change
elements.

We discussed the fact that it's important to pay attention to whether the method
is _destructive_ (i.e., it _mutates_ the array) or _nondestructive_. Another
factor to pay attention to is what the _return value_ of each of these methods
is. Be sure to follow along and experiment with each method in [replit][] until
you understand how it works, what it does to the original array, and what it
returns.

## Add Elements to an Array

We'll start with the JavaScript methods we can use to add elements to an array:
`.push()` and `.unshift()`, which are _destructive_ methods, and the spread
operator, which is _nondestructive_.

### `.push()` and `.unshift()`

These two methods work in the same way:

- They take one or more arguments (the element or elements you want to add)
- They _return_ the length of the modified array
- They are _destructive_ methods

The difference is that the `.push()` method adds elements to the end of an
`Array` and `.unshift()` adds them to the beginning of the array:

```js
const superheroes = ["Catwoman", "Storm", "Jessica Jones"];

superheroes.push("Wonder Woman");
// => 4

superheroes;
// => ["Catwoman", "Storm", "Jessica Jones", "Wonder Woman"]

const cities = ["New York", "San Francisco"];

cities.unshift("Boston", "Chicago");
// => 4

cities;
// => ["Boston", "Chicago", "New York", "San Francisco"]
```

Before moving on, try out the examples above as well as some examples of your
own in the REPL.

### Spread Operator

The _spread operator_, which looks like an ellipsis: `...`, allows us to "spread
out" the elements of an existing `Array` into a new `Array`, creating a copy:

```js
const coolCities = ["New York", "San Francisco"];

const copyOfCoolCities = [...coolCities];

copyOfCoolCities;
//=> ["New York", "San Francisco"]
```

You might wonder why we would do this rather than just
`copyOfCoolCities = coolCities`. The answer is that `coolCities` _points to a
location in memory_ and when you use the assignment operator to create a copy,
you create a second variable that points to the _same_ location. What this means
is that, if you change `copyOfCoolCities`, `coolCities` is changed as well (and
vice versa).

> **A note about copying arrays in JavaScript** Copying arrays in
> JavaScript is complicated! Some methods of copying create _deep_ copies and
> some create _shallow_ copies. Using the spread operator to copy an array
> creates a shallow copy. What this means is that, if you use it to copy a
> nested array, the inner array (or arrays) _still points to the same location
> in memory_ as in the original array. So if you modify the _inner_ array in the
> copy, it changes the inner array in the original array as well (and vice
> versa). Don't worry too much about shallow and deep copies at this point: just
> know that you can safely use the spread operator to clone _non-nested_ arrays.

Because the spread operator is an operator rather than a method, it
works differently than `push()` and `unshift()`: in the example above, we're
constructing an `Array` using _literal_ notation (i.e., typing the square
brackets) and populating it by using the spread operator on the `Array` we want
to copy.

Where the spread operator comes in especially handy is when we want to add one
or more new elements either before or after the elements in the original array
(or both) without mutating the original array. To add an element to the front of
the new array, we simply type in the new element before spreading the elements
in the original array:

```js
const coolCities = ["New York", "San Francisco"];

const allCities = ["Los Angeles", ...coolCities];

coolCities;
// => ["New York", "San Francisco"]

allCities;
// => ["Los Angeles", "New York", "San Francisco"]
```

And, as you might expect, to add a new item to the end of an `Array`, we type in
the new element _after_ spreading the elements in the original array:

```js
const coolCats = ["Hobbes", "Felix", "Tom"];

const allCats = [...coolCats, "Garfield"];

coolCats;
// => ["Hobbes", "Felix", "Tom"]

allCats;
// => ["Hobbes", "Felix", "Tom", "Garfield"]
```

Note that, in both cases, we created a new `Array` instead of modifying the
original one — our `coolCities` and `coolCats` `Array`s were untouched. Because
we didn't modify the original array, in order to save the results of our work we
had to assign it to a variable.

Be sure to experiment with the spread operator in [replit][] until you're
comfortable with how it works — it will come in handy later!

## Remove Elements from an Array

As complements for `.push()` and `.unshift()`, respectively, we have `.pop()`
and `.shift()`.

### `.pop()` and `.shift()`

As with `.push()` and `.unshift()`, these two methods work in the same way:

- they don't take any arguments
- they remove a single element
- they _return_ the element that is removed
- they are _destructive_ methods

The `.pop()` method removes the last element in an `Array`:

```js
const days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];

days.pop();
// => "Sun"

days;
// => ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"]
```

The `.shift()` method removes the first element in an `Array`:

```js
const days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];

days.shift();
// => "Mon"

days;
// => [Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
```

Notice above that both methods returned the removed element and mutated the
original array.

### `.slice()`

To remove elements from an `Array` nondestructively (without mutating the
original `Array`), we can use the `.slice()` method. Just as the name implies,
`.slice()` returns a portion, or **slice**, of an `Array`. The method takes 0,
1, or 2 arguments and returns a new array containing the sliced elements.

#### With No Arguments

If we don't provide any arguments, `.slice()` will return a copy of the original
`Array` with all elements intact:

```js
const primes = [2, 3, 5, 7];

const copyOfPrimes = primes.slice();

primes;
// => [2, 3, 5, 7]

copyOfPrimes;
// => [2, 3, 5, 7]
```

Note that creating a copy using `.slice()` works the same way as if you use the
spread operator: they both create a _shallow_ copy, and with both the copy
points to a different object in memory than the original. If you add an element
to one of the arrays, it does **not** get added to the others:

```js
const primes = [2, 3, 5, 7];

const copyOfPrimesUsingSlice = primes.slice();

const copyOfPrimesUsingSpreadOperator = [...primes];

primes.push(11);
// => 5

primes;
// => [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]

copyOfPrimesUsingSlice;
// => [2, 3, 5, 7]

copyOfPrimesUsingSpreadOperator;
// => [2, 3, 5, 7]
```

#### With Arguments

We can also provide one or two arguments to `.slice()`: the first is the index
where the slice should begin and the second is the index **before which** it
should end:

```js
const days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];

days.slice(2, 5);
// => ["Wed", "Thu", "Fri"]
```

If no second argument is provided, the slice will run from the index specified
by the first argument to the end of the `Array`:

```js
const days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];

days.slice(5);
// => ["Sat", "Sun"]
```

To return a new `Array` with the first element removed, we call `.slice(1)`:

```js
const days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];

days.slice(1);
// => ["Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]
```

And we can return an array with the last element removed in a way that will look
familiar from the previous lesson:

```js
const days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];

days.slice(0, days.length - 1);
// => ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"]
```

However, `.slice()` provides an easier syntax for referencing the last element
(or elements) in an `Array`:

```js
const days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];

days.slice(-1);
// => ["Sun"]

days.slice(-3);
// => ["Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]

days.slice(0, -1);
// => ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat"]
```

When we provide a negative index, the JavaScript engine knows to start counting
from the last element in the `Array` instead of the first.

### `.splice()`

Unlike `.slice()`, which is nondestructive, `.splice()` performs destructive
actions. Depending on how many arguments we give it, `.splice()` allows us to
remove elements, add elements, or replace elements (or any combination of the
three).

#### With a Single Argument

```js
array.splice(start);
```

The first argument expected by `.splice()` is the index at which to begin the
splice. If we only provide the one argument, `.splice()` will destructively
remove a chunk of the original `Array` beginning at the provided index and
continuing to the end of the `Array`:

```js
const days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];

days.splice(2);
// => ["Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]

days;
// => ["Mon", "Tue"]
```

Notice that `.splice()` **both** mutated the original array (by removing a
chunk, leaving just `["Mon", "Tue"]`) **and** returned a new array containing
the removed chunk.

We can use a negative 'start' index with `splice()`, the same as with `slice()`:

```js
const days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];
// => ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]

days.splice(-2);
// => ["Sat", "Sun"]

days;
// => ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"]
```

#### With Two Arguments

```js
array.splice(start, deleteCount);
```

When we provide two arguments to `.splice()`, the first is still the index at
which to begin splicing, and the second dictates how many elements we want to
remove from the `Array`. For example, to remove `3` elements, starting with the
element at index `2`:

```js
const days = ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"];
// => ["Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat", "Sun"]

days.splice(2, 3);
// => ["Wed", "Thu", "Fri"]

days;
// => ["Mon", "Tue", "Sat", "Sun"]
```

Here again, we see that `splice()` removed elements from the original array,
mutating that array, and returned the removed elements in a new array.

## Replace Elements in an Array

### `.splice()` with 3+ arguments

```js
array.splice(start, deleteCount, item1, item2, ...)
```

After the first two, every additional argument passed to `.splice()` will be
inserted into the `Array` at the position indicated by the first argument. We
can replace a single element in an `Array` as follows, discarding a card and
drawing a new one:

```js
const cards = [
  "Ace of Spades",
  "Jack of Clubs",
  "Nine of Clubs",
  "Nine of Diamonds",
  "Three of Hearts",
];

cards.splice(2, 1, "Ace of Clubs");
// => ["Nine of Clubs"]

cards;
// => ["Ace of Spades", "Jack of Clubs", "Ace of Clubs", "Nine of Diamonds", "Three of Hearts"]
```

We have deleted "Nine of Clubs" and inserted "Ace of Clubs" in place,
effectively _replacing_ the original card.

Or we can remove two elements and insert three new ones as our restaurant
expands its vegetarian options:

```js
const menu = [
  "Jalapeno Poppers",
  "Cheeseburger",
  "Fish and Chips",
  "French Fries",
  "Onion Rings",
];

menu.splice(1, 2, "Veggie Burger", "House Salad", "Teriyaki Tofu");
// => ["Cheeseburger", "Fish and Chips"]

menu;
// => ["Jalapeno Poppers", "Veggie Burger", "House Salad", "Teriyaki Tofu", "French Fries", "Onion Rings"]
```

We aren't required to remove anything with `.splice()` — we can use it to insert
any number of elements anywhere within an `Array` by passing 0 as the second
argument. Here we're adding new books to our library in alphabetical order:

```js
const books = ["Beloved", "Giovanni’s Room", "The Color Purple", "The Grass Dancer"];

books.splice(2, 0,  "Kindred", "Love Medicine");
// => []

books;
// => ['Beloved', 'Giovanni’s Room', 'Kindred', 'Love Medicine', 'The Color Purple', 'The Grass Dancer']
```

Notice that `.splice()` returns an empty `Array` when we provide a second
argument of `0`. This makes sense because the return value is the set of
elements that were removed, and we're telling it to remove `0` elements.

Keep playing around with `.splice()` in the REPL to get comfortable with it.

### Using Bracket Notation to Replace Elements

Recall from the previous lesson that we can also use bracket notation to replace
a single element in an `Array`. If we only need to replace one element, this is
a simpler approach:

```js
const cards = [
  "Ace of Spades",
  "Jack of Clubs",
  "Nine of Clubs",
  "Nine of Diamonds",
  "Three of Hearts",
];

cards[2] = "Ace of Clubs";
// => "Ace of Clubs"

cards;
// => ["Ace of Spades", "Jack of Clubs", "Ace of Clubs", "Nine of Diamonds", "Three of Hearts"]
```

Both this approach and `splice()` are destructive — they modify the original
`Array`. There's a _nondestructive_ way to replace or add items at arbitrary
points within an `Array`; to do it we need to combine the `slice()` method and
the spread operator.

### Slicing and Spreading

Combining `.slice()` and the spread operator allows us to replace elements
_nondestructively_, leaving the original `Array` unharmed:

```js
const menu = [
  "Jalapeno Poppers",
  "Cheeseburger",
  "Fish and Chips",
  "French Fries",
  "Onion Rings",
];

const newMenu = [
  ...menu.slice(0, 1),
  "Veggie Burger",
  "House Salad",
  "Teriyaki Tofu",
  ...menu.slice(3),
];

menu;
// => ["Jalapeno Poppers", "Cheeseburger", "Fish and Chips", "French Fries", "Onion Rings"]

newMenu;
// => ["Jalapeno Poppers", "Veggie Burger", "House Salad", "Teriyaki Tofu", "French Fries", "Onion Rings"]
```

Let's unpack this a little bit. We're assigning an array to `newMenu` using
literal notation. Inside the brackets, we are spreading the result of calling
slice on `menu` with the arguments `0` and `1`, then typing in three new
elements, then spreading the result of calling slice on `menu` with the argument
`3`. Here, we are taking advantage of the fact that the `slice()` method
**returns a new array**. We can spread the elements in **that** array just as we
can with any other array.

Play around with this in the REPL until it makes sense; break it down into its
component parts and try each piece on its own. It's the trickiest thing that
we've encountered in this lesson, so don't sweat it if it takes a little while
to sink in!

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we've learned a variety of methods we can use to remove, add,
and replace the elements in `Array`s. We've learned that some methods are
_destructive_ and some are _nondestructive_. With this knowledge, you have the
tools you need to manipulate `Array`s in very complex ways.
